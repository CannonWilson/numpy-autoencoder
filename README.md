# Numpy Autoencoder

This is a simple implementation of 
an autoencoder using only numpy
(torch is used for loading data)
to encode and decode digits
from the MNIST dataset.

If you want to modify any of the code, 
I suggest you create a virtual environment
with `python -m venv .env` and activate it
with `source .env/bin/activate`, then install 
all necessary packages with 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Take a look at example.ipynb to see a
demo and the results.
